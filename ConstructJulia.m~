% Question 3: iii.- Constructing the Julia set. Remember the Julia set is 
%the boundary of the
Filled Julia set. We here are going to give an algorithm to generate the Julia set.
It is called the Inverse Iteration method: Given a complex number z = x + iy =
r(cos?+sin?)withr= x2+y2 and?=tan?1y whenx>0(adding?ifx<0) ?  x
and z = r cos ? + r sin ? . Use these expressions to develop an iteration method 2?2
whose function is ? = ± w ? c. For each number you can randomly pick the positive or negative value of the expression for ?. Verify your program using the values you used before.


function ConstructJulia(c,num_points)
pick = round(rand);
if pick
    julia_set = 0.5*(1 + sqrt(1-4*c));
else
    julia_set = 0.5*(1 - sqrt(1-4*c));
end
for k = 1:num_points
    pick = round(rand);
    if pick
        next = sqrt(julia_set(end) - c); 
    else
        next = -sqrt(julia_set(end) - c);
    end
    julia_set = [julia_set; next];
end

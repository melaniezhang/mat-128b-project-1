DUE WEDNESDAY 2/21/2018!!!

i- An introduction to fractals
 Convince that the filled Julia set of z^2 is the unit disk
 Say on the x-y plane we have the unit disk and we have z = a + bi, x = a and y = b on the plane.
 In the iteration of z^2, if we take a <= 1 and b <= 1 then after several iterations, the points tend to converge inside the disk; if on the other hand, we have a > 1 and b > 1 then we have a and b diverging after serveral itertions. 
 So the Filled Julia set of z^2 is the unit disk.
